    "Hong Kong is famous for being a ‘food paradise’. With a colossal 66 Michelin-starred restaurants, it has proven itself one of the most amazing and diverse restaurant cities globally. Matching with the high-end lifestyle of Hong Kong people, there are limitless choices on fine dining restaurants. Therefore, it is not easy for a new business to survive in the market. A strategic location would be vital for a great start of the restaurant. In this project, geospatial analysis and data science methodology and techniques like K-means clustering will be performed to determine the optimal location to establish a fine dining restaurant in Hong Kong. \n"
